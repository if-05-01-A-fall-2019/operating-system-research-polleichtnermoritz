Z/OS is a 64-bit operating system (OS) developed by IBM for its family of z/Architecture enterprise mainframe computers.

Z/OS is described as an extremely scalable and secure high-performance operating system based on the 64-bit z/Architecture. 
Like its predecessor, OS/390, z/OS lays claim to being highly reliable for running mission-critical applications. The operating 
system supports web- and Java-based applications.

An Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF) provides tools for host-based software development, including a Dialog Manager 
for visual interface components, a Program Development Facility (PDF) to assist developers in editing and compiling, a Software 
Configuration and Library Manager (SCLM) to manage all of the software components of an application and a client-server component. 
The Language Environment provides a runtime environment for programs generated with C, C++, COBOL, Fortran and PL/I languages. 
The Metal C Runtime Library offers LPA-resident C functions that IT can call from a C program created with the z/OS XL C compiler.
